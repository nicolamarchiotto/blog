I am Nicola Marchiotto, a Robotic and Software Engineer. 

<br>
Computer Science is what I am good at, and it is part of my daily routine. In my free time I like to work on various projects, which I use as starting points to explore always something new. I am an amateur soccer player and an occasional reader who takes an eternity to finish a book.
