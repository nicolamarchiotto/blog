## What is this website about
I thought, "Why not? Having a place where people can easily get a glance at my CV and see what I can do, seems a pretty neat idea". That was late July 2023, I hoped to get things started more quickly, but I did not took into considerations my stubborness regarding all the minor details that I needed to be satisfied with. After 5 months, I finally reached a point which makes me happy.

## How it was made
The website was developed using [zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a simple framework which resembles the look of classic html. Its primary purpose is to share my portfolio to the world. The *blog* sections is there to keep track of my projects in a nice and fancy way. The "posts" are not intended to be tutorials, they are just things I did, the goal obviuosly is to do *cool* things.

## Deploy
The website was deployed using [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), a service where you can easily host your website. The platform offers you 100 GB of bandwidth per month free. It can be easily integrated with standard versioning providers like Git, has the possibility to set a purchased domain name and many more free feature which I did not had yet the chance the explore. 

## Want to try it yourself?
Before start working, I would suggest you to understand how and where you want to host your website. Not all providers are free and choosing the right one for the framework you want to use, can easily save you a lot of money. If you would like to developed something similar of what I build, [zola themes sections](https://www.getzola.org/themes/) has hundreds of templates which can be taken as starting point.
