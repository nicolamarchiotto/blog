## What is the website about
I wanted to present myself better to the world, have a place where I can keep track of the things I do and learn something new. These are the main motivations behind this website. 

I started working on it in late July 2023, with the goal of putting the site online in few months. I have to say that more than "few months" passed, mainly because of the never ending tweaks on the user interface. There are obviosly still things I want to improve, but for now I would say this is enough.

I chose english as main language of the blog so to keep my hand in. Some practice surely will not hurt.

## How it was made
The website was developed using [zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a simple framework which resembles the look of classic html. The *blog* sections is there to keep track of my projects in a nice and fancy way. The "posts" are not intended to be tutorials, they are just *cool* things I was interested it and that I explored.

The website was deployed using [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), a service where you can easily host your website. The platform offers you 100 GB of bandwidth per month free. It can be easily integrated with standard versioning providers like Git. It offers also the possibility a custom domain name for your website. I bought mine on [porkbun](https://porkbun.com/) for around 10 â‚¬/year.

## Want to try it yourself?
Before you tart working, I would suggest to understand how and where you want to host your website. Not all providers are free and choosing the right one for the framework you want to use, can easily save you a lot of money. If you would like to developed something similar of what I build, [zola themes sections](https://www.getzola.org/themes/) has hundreds of templates which can be taken as starting point.
