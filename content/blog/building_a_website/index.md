## What is the website about?
I wanted to present myself better to the world, have a place where I could keep track of the things I do, and learn something new. These are the main motivations behind this website.

I started working on it in late July 2023, with the goal of putting the site online in a few months. I have to say that more than "few months" passed, mainly because of the never-ending tweaks to the user interface. There are obviously still things I want to improve, but I would say this is enough for now.

I chose English as the main language of the blog to get some practice with the language every now and then.

## How it was made
The website was developed using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a simple framework that resembles the look of classic HTML. The *blog* sections is there to keep track of my projects in a nice and fancy way. The "posts" are not intended to be tutorials; they are just cool things I was interested in and that I explored.

The website was deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), a service where you can easily host your website. The platform offers you 100 GB of free bandwidth per month. It can be easily integrated with standard versioning providers like Git. It also offers the possibility of setting a custom domain name for your website. I bought mine on [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/) for around 10 euros a year.

## Want to try it yourself?
Before you start working, I would suggest that you understand how and where you want to host your website. Not all providers are free, and choosing the right one for the framework you want to use can easily save you a lot of money. If you would like to develop something similar to what I built, the [Zola themes section](https://www.getzola.org/themes/) has hundreds of templates that can be taken as a starting point.
